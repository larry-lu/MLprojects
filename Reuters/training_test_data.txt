296,trade,"poland says us sanctions have cost its economy  billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago     polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms, one banking source said     but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate     they say it is blurred by the poor performance of polands economy, and dismiss the  billion dlr figure as illusory     sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems, one said     the us imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in  in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission     according to one western envoy, an expert on polish economic affairs, it extrapolated  information on growth trends in trade with the united states, as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders     but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation     a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the us in the late s averaged around  mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed     imports have suffered, slumping from around  mln dlrs to  mln, as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted  billion, official figures show     acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important us markets  including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs  western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons  poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons, said one expert its an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy     theres a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it, another said, adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer todays reality     describing the  billion dlr assessment as nebulous, one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges  western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland, which has a hard currency debt of  billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry     mfn doesnt really mean anything, only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the us market because different forces are in play now, said one western envoy     he said polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the us, japan and europe would also hamper polands efforts to regain entry     deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently     kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently, making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about  mln dlrs     while poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a moral right to assistance from the us which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that us sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy wont cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity     nevertheless, polish national bank head wladyslaw baka, in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank, made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states     he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states, but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners     he stressed that the us had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of polands partners interested in the settlement of polish debt     putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank, imf and paris club of western creditor

megabank which could swap third world debt paper for socalled exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions     such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of  billion dlrs     he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested     other us officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described     but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states     if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine i dont think they ever will     he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution     meanwhile, the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than  pct above libor     the philippine proposal is very interesting, its quite unique and i dont think its something that should be categorically rejected out of hand, the official said     banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes     these tradeable, dollardenominated notes would have a sixyear life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of  point over libor     until now, bankers have

rescheduled debt the country, which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall  billion dlrs of debt     but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks its no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before, the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money, he added     he said the us debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines  reuter "

target range for the narrow m measure would be two to six pct in fiscal      no explicit target was set for the broad sterling m aggregate, he said but broad money will continue to be taken into account in assessing monetary conditions, as of course will the exchange rate, the chancellor told parliament     lawson said the low outturn of the psbr in  is chiefly attributable to the remarkable buoyancy of nonoil tax revenues in general, and the corporation tax paid by an increasingly profitable business sector in particular     on oil prices, lawson said he was sticking to his earlier assumption that north sea crude prices will average  dlrs per barrel in calendar      he said it is clear that the increased flow of nonoil tax revenues, coupled with the prospective further growth of the economy in excess of the growth of public expenditure, puts the public finances in a very strong position     lawson said the treasury would strive to keep the psbr at  pct of gdp in future     we have reached what i judge to be the medium term financial strategys appropriate destination  a psbr of  pct of gdp my aim will be to keep it there over the years ahead, lawson said     inevitably,

of prudence and caution, and to build a still firmer base for the future     lawson said the time had come to strike the exchange control act from the statute book     on corporation tax, he said the

present treatment of tax credit relief for foreign withholding tax paid on interest on bank loans, also from april      in future, banks will be able to offset this tax credit only against tax on the

1043,fx,"the dollar is near appropriate levels against european currencies and the yen, and a further fall could damage confidence in the currency while endangering world economic growth, a top bundesbank official said     board member leonhard gleske also told a forex association conference current exchange rates of major currencies can be viewed as equilibrium levels in a mediumterm perspective     he said the recent paris agreement on currency stabilisation and policy coordination between the group of five and canada may herald an era of greater exchange rate stability     the paris agreement was not, however, an attempt to set up permanent target zones for exchange rates, gleske stressed, adding such targets would be extremely difficult to agree and enforce on an international level     at present levels the dollar can no longer be considered grossly overvalued in relation to the european currencies and the yen, gleske said     he said the dollar had fallen much less against currencies of important trading nations such as canada, korea, taiwan and hong kong, and further falls there may still be necessary     but a further dollar depreciation against major european currencies and the yen may not be the best way to restore the dollar to a fully competitive position, as measured by its weighted external value, he said    in fact, a further marked decline in the dollar rate would hold two major dangers, gleske said     first, in countries with large balance of payments surpluses such as japan and west germany, it threatened to hamper economic growth and thus slow down the expansion of real income and domestic expenditure necessary to wipe out surpluses     second, in the united states, it could damage investors confidence in the dollar and thus reduce their willingness to finance huge fiscal and external payments deficits, gleske said     gleske also was strongly sceptical that an international system of binding target zones for currencies, fluctuating in narrow bands against each other, can be established such targets threatened to cause policy conflicts, both within countries and between them     for instance, the us reliance on foreign capital to fund its deficits requires interest rates there be set at high levels, but domestic considerations call for low ones     if target zones were established, this would put pressure on other countries to reduce their interest rates even more, even though this may be in conflict with their own domestic situation and priorities, he said     gleske added, targeting the exchange rate even within a wide margin will meet with serious objections where there is a clearly perceived potential for conflict between domestic and external policy priorities     commenting on the paris currency accord, gleske said its chances of stabilising exchange rates rested heavily on current interest rate differentials being maintained     these chances seem to me to rest critically on the expectation that the current configuration of interest rates, and the monetary policies behind them, will assure smooth financing of current account imbalances in the months ahead     gleske said past experience of currency adjustments had learned that markets are inclined to be impatient and will thus tend to overshoot he said this would seem to be unnecessary and should be avoided if at all possible     monetary policies can help achieve this, but only if markets believe that pledged changes in fiscal policies will lead to balanced international payments, he said  reuter "

1126,sugar,"latin american sugar producers are awaiting further rises in world market prices before moving to boost production, official and trade sources said     although prices have risen to around eight from five us cents per lb in the past six months, they are still below the regions nine to ten cents per lb average production cost     the recent rise in prices has placed producers on the alert, manuel rico, a consultant with the group of latin american and caribbean sugar exporting countries geplacea, told reuters     however, rico said, it would require another five to seven cents to stimulate notable increases in output     producers are taking measures for increasing their production when the prices are profitable, he said     officials in mexico, guatemala and ecuador said a continued rise in prices would stimulate production, but industry leaders in panama and costa rica said there was still a long way to go     the prices are ridiculous, said julian mateo, vice president of costa ricas sugar cane industrialagricultural league at current prices nobody is going to consider increasing production     other producers are wary of committing funds to increasing output, given the instability of world markets     an official at colombias national association of sugar cane growers said they had no plans to raise export targets the market is very unstable what is happening is not yet giving way to a pattern and so there is no reason to modify anything     in , the latest year for which full figures are available, central and south american nations produced  mln tonnes, raw value, of sugar of which  mln were exported a year earlier, they had produced and exported about , more, according to the londonbased international sugar organization     years of continuous low prices have plunged the sugar industry in many countries in the region into a recession from which it will be hard to recover     miguel guerrero, director of the dominican republics national sugar institute, said it would be difficult to boost production even if prices recovered sharply     output had slumped to under , tonnes a year from , in the late s obsolete refineries, poor transport and badly maintained plantations were barriers to any short term recovery in output, he added     plans of nearby cuba, the worlds largest cane sugar exporter, to increase output to  mln tonnes a year by the end of the decade seem ambitious, trade sources said output is running well below the record  mln produced in      cuba suffers from run down plantations, harvesting problems and poor processing facilities more than from low world prices, since much of its output is sold to eastern bloc countries under special deals last year, bad weather added to its troubles, and output fell to  mln tonnes from  mln in      the low world prices of recent years have led many countries in the region to cut exportable production to levels where they barely cover us and, in the case of some caribbean countries, european community ec import quotas, for which they receive prices well above free market levels     progressive reductions in the us quotas have led to production stagnating or falling rather than being shifted to the free world market     peru, for example, shipped , tonnes to the us in both  and  this fell to , in  and this year its quota is only ,     a national cooperative official said that, as long as world market levels continue at around half of perus production cost, the future of the industry is uncertain     at a meeting of geplacea in brazil last october officials stressed the need to find alternative uses for sugar cane which, according to the groups executivesecretary eduardo latorre, grows like a weed throughout the region     brazil, the largest cane producer with output of around  mln tonnes, uses over half to produce alcohol fuel cane in excess of internal demand for alcohol and sugar is refined into sugar for sale abroad to earn much needed foreign currency     the difference in the price the staterun sugar and alcohol institute iaa pays local industry and what it receives from foreign buyers costs the government some  mln dlrs a year     soaring domestic demand for both alcohol and sugar over the past year, coupled with a droughtreduced cane crop, has meant brazil will have difficulties in meeting export commitments in , trade sources said negotiations to delay shipments to next year have been indecisive so far, the main sticking point being how brazil should compensate buyers for nondelivery of sugar it had sold at around five cents per lb and which would cost eight cents to replace     brazilian sugar industry sources said new sugar export sales were expected to be extremely low for the next year, with the institute wary of exposing itself to domestic shortages of either alcohol or sugar and because of the need to rebuild depleted reserve stockpiles     however, the situation could change dramatically if the economy goes into recession and internal demand slumps     sources within latin america and the caribbean hold little hope for the regions sugar industry to return to profitability unless the us and ec change their policies     the agricultural policies of the european community and of the united states have caused our economies incalculable harm by closing their markets, by price deterioration in international commerce and furthermore by the unfair competition in third countries, brazils trade and industry minister jose hugo castelo branco told the october geplacea meeting     the ec has come under prolonged attack from geplacea for what the group charges is its continued dumping of excess output on world markets geplacea officials say this is the main cause of low prices     geplacea sees a new international sugar agreement which would regulate prices as one of the few chances of pulling the regions industry out of steady decline such an agreement would have to have both us and ec backing and industrialised countries would have to see it as a political rather than a merely economic pact     they have to realise that the more our economies suffer, the less capcity

lower trade barriers and revalue currencies     but this twopronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and, in any case, will only work with a sizeable lag, economists say

those countries that we can attribute to currency changes, said bethlehem steels wendt     and so far, us pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little

of the exchange rate to change japanese policies it was a pointed reminder to japan to do something about the trade issues, the source said of the dollars fall against the yen     by departing last

budget problems and its associated huge deficits are said to be at the root of related international trade friction currently worrying financiers     as the dollar slides downward on global markets and stock exchanges gyrate wildly, the trade dispute involving the united states and japan once again is spreading fears of a major trade war between the two trading giants for the first time since world war ii     ostensibly that dispute is over us charges that japan is refusing to open its markets to semiconductor chips and the resulting us tariffs doubling prices of japanese televisions and small computers     behind the elements of a brewing trade war which neither side wants, is the dilemma of the us budget and its deficit     some analysts say the financial markets may be waking up to

house, calling for slashing the deficit from its estimated  billion dlr level next year to about  billion dlrs, through defense and domestic spending cuts and about  billion dlrs in new, unspecified,

budget with reagan  who already is opposed to the idea but it is not clear how the republicans will act, he added     he said republicans may propose their own plan for lower taxes and more defense spending, which they did not offer after reagans budget was clobbered in an early vote in the house      when reagan entered the white house in , he inherited what was labelled a huge deficit from jimmy carter that wound up to be nearly  billion dlrs that year     despite reagans promise to balance the budget by , critics note that his administrations record of accumulated debt is estimated over one trillion dlrs, or , billion dlrs     that is money the government must borrow, and pay back, and many analysts say it is what kept the dollar high and caused the worst us trade deficit ever      last year the united states bought goods from the world worth  billion dlrs more than what it sold, including purchases of  billion dlrs in japanese goods     while congress is trying to attack the trade deficit on one front through a gettough trade bill promising retaliatory measures unless all markets are opened, its success so far against the budget deficit has been marked by limited progress     congress, which controls the pursestrings, has put the deficit on a downward path from its record high of  billion dlrs accumulated in fiscal , which ended sept      because of the grammrudmanhollings balanced budget law enacted in late , there has been pressure on congress to do more than talk about deficits     that law, named after republican senators phil gramm of texas,

its april report that another expected phase of dollar weakness would prompt the bundesbank to cut key money market rates in the next three to six months     the bundesbank has set a fixed rate of  pct on repurchase pacts since february, with call money trading around  pct for much of april     phillips and drew senior european economist richard reid said the bundesbank would allow interest rates to ease further, either with a lower fixed rate tender, or a tender by interest rate, allowing the market to set the rate     im fairly confident well see lower rates, he said     reid said taking  basis points off the repurchase rate would have little impact on the german economy or fundamental exchange rates, but could change market currency perceptions     a cut in german rates wouldnt be bad for the dollar, but i think its effect would be limited in duration unless it was accompanied by other measures elsewhere, he said     money market dealers here noted the speculation abroad that the bundesbank would push down repurchase rates, but said the bundesbank had little reason to cut rates further at the moment, despite the liquid market seen for most of this month     the dealers said the bundesbank was likely to move to an interest rate tender for its repurchase pacts next month that should not be seen as a sign of easing monetary policy however, they said     the bundesbank would merely be experimenting with interest rate tenders, following the introduction of a new system to speed up the tender process at the start of april, they said     reinhard pohl, head of the monetary policy section at the diw economic research institute in west berlin, said the bundesbank would probably not cut rates on repurchase pacts     i dont think that if they cut the repurchase rate a little it would stop a wave of currency speculation, he said but a sharp and sudden deterioration in the dollar could force the bundesbank to take some action, he said     pohl said the bundesbank was concerned that a cut in interest rates would accelerate excessive monetary growth     some bundesbank officials have argued recently that the monetary overshoot was due to strong currency inflows rather than credit growth, and therefore a more appropriate response to excessive money supply growth would be to cut rates, to make the mark and mark investments less attractive     pohl said the bundesbank was hoping that domestic investors would switch funds parked in liquid shortterm accounts, which have swollen central bank money stock, into securities, which would take them out of the bundesbanks key monetary measure     a cut in interest rates at this stage however would lead investors to assume that rates had bottomed out and the next move would be upwards they would therefore hold off buying bonds, leaving central bank money stock swollen     there are so far no signs that german investors are switching funds into long term securities as the bundesbank hopes they will, berliner handels und frankfurter bank economist hermann remsperger said     but phillips and drews reid said prospects of lower rates and a strong currency would attract foreign investors into german bonds, which would in turn attract domestic investors     werner rein, chief economist at union bank of switzerland in zurich, said he thought it likely that interest rates would continue to drift lower in many european countries     the scope for lower rates is probably greatest in britain but more limited in west germany, where we could see some consolidation, he said switzerland could be forced to match any cut in german rates to prevent the franc rising further against the mark, he said     currency dealers in london said another halfpoint cut in uk bank base rates was likely in the next few weeks as the pound had shrugged off yesterdays cuts and was still rising  reuter "

3226,coffee,"european coffee traders and roasters may propose a new formula for calculating international coffee organization ico coffee quotas at the end of their meeting here this week, traders and officials told reuters     although traders were unwilling to reveal details of the possible new formula, they said it would give brazil, the worlds biggest coffee producer, unchanged ico quotas for the next two years and could be a basis for renegotiation     the main sticking point on quotas has been brazils attitude, and this compromise could be a solution,  one said     however, the european coffee trade federation meeting, which began here today and is to continue to the end of the week, has revealed gaps in the european position on reintroducing quotas     traders said that, as a whole, the trade side was against reintroduction of ico quotas, while roasters were generally in favour with the single proviso that there had to be some formula basis for reallocating quota shares among producing countries     the roasters said the positions were generally fairly close, and problems with some government officials     germany and italy were cited as the extremes of polarized government attitudes, with most other countries on the fence     sources said germany was the most extreme against quota reintroduction, while the italians were most in favour     nevertheless, we expect to find enough common ground by the end of the week to at least present a common european community ec view at the next meeting of consumer members of the international coffee agreement ica in july, one trader said     we hope we can present the compromise proposal and that not only the consumer side, but the producer side will accept it, one official said     we have learned that we can live without the quotas that were suspended in february last year, but would prefer the stability they can bring to the market as long as we do not simply return to the old and outdated status quo as far as quota allocation is concerned, he added     overall, however, trader and roaster opinion on the likelihood of a successful renegotiation was mildly pessimistic, varying between a  chance and  against     our main difficulty will be to persuade the us on the consumer side and brazil on the producer side to agree to quota reintroduction,  he said     the us position has, if anything, hardened, while the new brazilian coffee institute president has adopted the least negotiable position of any of his predecessors, one trader said     however, with many producers starting to swing in favour of the consumer position that quotas have to be reallocated under a new formula, brazil is becoming increasingly isolated, which gives at least some hope of a compromise at the ico quota meeting in september, the official said  reuter "
3227,crude,"some opec states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its sixmonthold price and output pact in vienna next week, oil analysts say     they said nigeria, which holds the opec conference presidency, and qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive     there has also been speculation by japanese traders that opec might want to mark up prices of highsulphur heavy crudes, to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices     but most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely, so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in opecs new unity     all opec members can make a good case for changing differentials, said one analyst with a major oil company but at the end of the day, the attitude is going to be leave well alone and little or nothing is likely to be altered     iran, libya and saudi arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year, traders say but diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and, in some cases, marketing incentives have helped their sales     some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts, processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a package     many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced, at least for some part of the year but many experts say opec should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oilrich heavy crudes and gasolinerich lighter grades at its last meeting in december, opec agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from february  around an  dlr per barrel reference point official prices had been effectively dropped in  when members offered discounts to attract customers     opec also decided to limit firsthalf  output to  mln bpd and proposed ceilings of  mln for the third quarter and  mln for the fourth analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months     spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices, but opec will probably keep the  dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials, analysts say     the  dlr figure is based on a basket of six opec and one nonopec crudes opec assigned prices to its other key export crudes, with a  dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest extra heavy crudes were among those left out     industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oil exports actually sold at official prices several experts say only onequarter to onethird of the total in fact sells at official prices, with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products     problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year, when some producers output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices    nigeria especially found its gasolinerich bonny light crude  now opecs highest priced grade at  dlrs a barrel  was uncompetitive on the spot market against britains brent     in february and march, nigerias production shrank below its  mln bpd opec quota spot prices have since revived, due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline, and its output has risen     some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between  cts to one dlr a barrel     but mehdi varzi, chief oil analyst with londons kleinwort grieveson securities, doubts nigeria will actively push the differentials question in vienna     it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria, which holds the presidency, raised the issue, he said  reuter "
